# Installing tmux
In order to install tmux you will need to use the bash script for installing tmux called tmux_install.sh. I will have one bash script per tool to make things simpler.
As an overview what this script will do is call stow linking the .tmux.conf file to the home directory. And git cloning the tmux plugin manager (tpm).
